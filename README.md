# CloudCoinCore-2.0
CloudCoinCore Version 2.0 With Performance and structural enhancements


Here are the proposed Changes:
NOTE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE THE TOP THREE

* 1. Help button. This button would show the Help Desk's contact info; URL to CloudCoinwiki, FAQs, Links to video page.

* 2. Secondary DNS support. This would allow for us to hardcode a second DNS address that the client could check and use if it is faster than the CloudFlare. However, we are still deciding on the final implementation of this. 

* 3. Cloud Collectables support. When exporting, the client will check with the Collectable's server to see if it has a custome JPEG. If it does it will get a ticket from the fasted RAIDA and take it to the Collectables serer. The Collectables server then give the client the jpeg. 

4. Support new file formats besides JPEG and .STACK . Specifically supporting QR codes that would be displayed and printed out. 

5. Support for Store-in-mind (but we need to figure out a better way) perhaps. 

6. Check writing and Check cashing abilities to work with CloudBank.

7. List all serial number in a folder.

8. Export for sale 

9. International (supports multi languages).

10. For mobile apps, support for recovering exported coins. 

11. Counterfeit coins get a txt file explaining why they were counterfeit. 

12. Support for Splitting (multiplying of coins)

13. Contrast (Change the way it looks so blind people can see)

14. Automatic Updates and website downloads. Gitinsky knows how to do this. 

15. Lost Coin Report Support

16. Flexable jpegs. Allow jpegs to be dropped into template folder. (This may be just a matter of figuring out which graphic programs should save the jpegs. 

17. Integration with Protonmail Bridge. Allows people to send CloudCoins directly from their desktop using protonmail if they have Protonmail bridge installed.
